   - You should see the Sanity Studio interface

2. **Add Your First Content:**

   **Step 1: Create Technologies**
   - Go to "Technology" in the sidebar
   - Add technologies like: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, etc.
   - Make sure to fill out the name and slug fields

   **Step 2: Create Your First Project**
   - Go to "Project" in the sidebar
   - Click "Create" ‚Üí "Project"
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - Title: One of your project names
     - Description: Project description
     - Technologies: Reference the technologies you created
     - GitHub URL: Your GitHub repository URL
     - Live URL: Your demo URL
     - Achievements: Add some key achievements

3. **Test the Integration:**
   - After adding a project, check your portfolio site
   - Open browser console and look for the message:

- ‚úÖ Environment Variables: Configured with your project ID (2wmvbh5j)
- ‚úÖ Schemas: Project, Technology, Skill, About are ready

### Troubleshooting:
- If you see "Using projects from: Local data", it means either:
  - No projects have been created in Sanity yet, or
  - There's a CORS issue (needs to be configured in Sanity dashboard)

### CORS Configuration:
1. Go to https://sanity.io/manage/project/2wmvbh5j
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Add CORS origins:
   - http://localhost:5173
   - http://localhost:5174
   - http://localhost:5175
   - Your production domain when you deploy

Start by creating some technologies and then your first project in the Sanity Studio!
